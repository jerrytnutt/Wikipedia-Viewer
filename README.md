# Wikipedia-Viewer

# This is an older project I completed back in 2017, not an indication of current abilities.

This app uses JavaScript Jquery CSS3 and HTML5 and the implementation of the the Wikipedia's API to search for the articles. The app can open to a random wikipedia article amd append the page with wiki articles based on the users input.
